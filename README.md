# Farmer-Tech2022

## Inspiration
A one stop Solution to all Farmers Problem
With advancement in technology every sector is progressing but one of the sectors that are lacking behind is the Agriculture sector.

## What it does
Farmers usually face a lot of problems from the time of sowing the seeds to the time produce reaches the end customer.Some of the problems faced are knowledge of Temperature and Humidity,According to soil conditions which are best crop to grow,If in case any plant got effected by some disease then knowledge of which disease and what is the solution for the same and last but not the least awareness about government schemes related to farmers and after doing all this thing the profit earned by farmers are quite less because they have predefined vendors who buy the product at very low price and since farmer has to run his livelihood he makes this deal and faces loss.

## How we built it
So in order to tackle this problem we are developing a solution which will entail solution to all above mentioned problems and besides this we will also be developing a B2B market place which will give a global selling exposure to farmers and help them increasing their profit.

## Challenges we ran into
So there are ton,some of the challenges are as we were using React.js at frontend and faced a lot of difficulty in handling state through Redux and also faced a lot of errors while integrating backend with the frontend and also while integrating the payment gateway with Razorpay

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
yes i proude myself and this hackathon

## What we learned
many technology i learn this hackathon time.....

## What's next for Indian Farmer Tech
also while integrating the payment gateway with Razorpay and many more....
